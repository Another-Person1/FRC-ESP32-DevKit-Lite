## 10/8/2025 - Forked the design  

Forked from: https://oshwlab.com/sikaxn/seal-v2-dev-board

Changes made:

    Changed ESP32-WROOM-32D-N4 module to ESP32-MINI-1-H4 module, as the WROOM-32D is NRND(not recommended for new designs), and the MINI-1 is more compact
    Removed relay and changed that to a JST PH 3-pin connector (I donâ€™t know what the relay is for, and it takes up a lot of space)
    Changed RGB LED to 3535 NeoPixel addressable LED (saves 2 pins)
    Changed 1 4 pin header strip for I2C to JST-PH 4 pin (Stemma and Rev compatible)
    Changed CP2104 to CP2102N as CP2104 is obsolete according to Silicon Labs

Changes to do:

    Clean up schematic
    Make a PCB (not sure if editing yours or creating a new one from scratch is faster though)
    Transfer all the pins to the new module
    Add more JST PH connectors for IO
    Add external power supply input
    Make buttons smaller
    Might get rid of JTAG connector (originally planned to use latest version of NINA-W106 from u-blox, but it was slightly more expensive)

## 10/14/2025 - Routed the PCB  

The original design was getting a bit too complicated to route, so I changed it to become a FeatherWing instead.

This way I don't have to design the microcontroller portion and the board is more simplified.

The feature set is the same as before except for unnecessary components removed, both before and because of this change.

## 10/19/2025 - Added ground plane and silkscreen  

Finished adding the ground plane and the silkscreen in this timeframe, making it look more professional and improves heat distribution.
Now I need to make a few finishing touches and I should be ready to ship.
- Add a overvoltage protection chip
- Fix the power connection to the Feather
